# Security Policy - AuraPartner MVP

## Enterprise Security Standards

This repository implements enterprise-grade security controls meeting:

- **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley)** compliance requirements for financial reporting integrity
- **ISO 27001** information security management standards
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework** comprehensive security controls
- **Enterprise audit** requirements for complete traceability

## Security Features Implementation

### Code Integrity and Non-Repudiation
- **SSH Commit Signing**: All commits are cryptographically signed with SSH keys
- **Signature Verification**: GitHub displays "Verified" status for all commits
- **Immutable History**: Linear history maintains complete audit trail
- **Branch Protection**: Prevents unauthorized direct pushes to main branches

### Access Control Framework
- **CODEOWNERS**: Mandatory reviews for all changes to critical files
- **Branch Protection Rules**: Enforce approval workflows before merging
- **Status Checks**: Automated security scanning before code integration
- **Auto-merge**: Only after all security validations pass

### Pre-Commit Security Validation
- **Secret Detection**: Prevents accidental exposure of credentials
- **Large File Blocking**: Prevents repository bloat and potential data leaks
- **Code Quality**: Automated linting and formatting enforcement
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection for dependencies

### Audit Trail and Compliance
- **Complete Cryptographic Chain**: Every change is cryptographically signed
- **Full Traceability**: All changes tracked with verified authorship
- **Compliance Reporting**: Automated generation of audit reports
- **Legal Trail**: Non-repudiation for intellectual property protection

## Dual-Purpose AI Platform Security

### Data Protection
- **Context Isolation**: User contexts are cryptographically separated
- **Memory Management**: Secure handling of sensitive conversation data
- **API Security**: All endpoints require authentication and authorization
- **Data Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption for all user data

### AI Model Security
- **Model Versioning**: Cryptographically signed model deployments
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization of user inputs
- **Output Filtering**: Prevent exposure of sensitive information
- **Audit Logging**: All AI interactions are logged for compliance

## Reporting Security Issues

### Internal Reporting
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Preferred method for vulnerability disclosure
- **Email**: security@aurapartner.com for sensitive issues
- **Escalation**: Critical issues escalated to CTO within 2 hours

### External Reporting
- **Coordinated Disclosure**: 90-day disclosure timeline
- **Bug Bounty**: Planned program for external security researchers
- **Recognition**: Public acknowledgment for responsible disclosure

## Compliance Standards

### SOX Compliance (Sarbanes-Oxley)
- **Change Control**: All code changes require approval and are auditable
- **Data Integrity**: Cryptographic signatures ensure data hasn't been tampered with
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with comprehensive logging
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of all changes with verified authorship

### ISO 27001 Information Security
- **Risk Assessment**: Regular security assessments and threat modeling
- **Security Controls**: Implementation of technical and administrative safeguards
- **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for security incident handling
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated security monitoring and alerting

### NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- **Identify**: Asset inventory and risk assessment processes
- **Protect**: Access control, data security, and protective technology
- **Detect**: Security monitoring and anomaly detection
- **Respond**: Incident response planning and communications
- **Recover**: Recovery planning and improvements based on lessons learned
